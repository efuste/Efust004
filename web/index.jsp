            <p>The service my web app will be providing is the ability for a person to add movies they would like to see.  For now the
               only information you will be able to add is movie title, a note by the user and  the movie rating.  The web app will be a simplified 
               version of a website like imdb or rotten tomatoes.  I hope to extend my web app as the class progresses to more closely
               mimic some of the features of a website like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. I hope to implement features such as movie pages with 
               details of the movie with the ability to add to a wishlist and more if class time permits.</p>
