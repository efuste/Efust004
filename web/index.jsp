        <p>The service my web app will be providing is the ability for a person to add movies they would like to see.  For now the
            only information you will be able to is is movie title, a note by the user and  the movie rating.  The web app will be a simplified 
        version of a website like imdb or rotten tomatoes.  I hope to extend my web app as the class progresses to more closely
        mimic some of the features of a website like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
